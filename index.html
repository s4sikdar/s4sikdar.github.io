                the basics of web development, and SQL/databases. I can potentially work
                in Front-End or Back-End development, or perhaps even Automation Testing.

            This is basically the same as above, except that text is there on both

            see this pattern of text being shown on both the column of "left" and "right",
            then on just the "right" column ("left" and "right" being class names).

                    Over the spring term, I took a course in relational databases,
                    where I learned how to write SQL statements using the SQLite3
                    Database Management System. I use this to revamp my original
                    Tic-Tac-Toe game, storing user-profiles via the SQLite3 DBMS.
                    I also created a Database using SQL statements for a final project
                    in that class that I later put on Github as a side project -
                    titled "CS-338-Final-Project". <br>

              <strong>Description: </strong>
              My final project for CS-338 - course on relational databases, using
              SQL via SQLite3. I created a database of NBA Records over the last 10
              years, with information regarding standings, team records, NBA General
              Manager records, NBA Coach records, and NBA Finals records.
