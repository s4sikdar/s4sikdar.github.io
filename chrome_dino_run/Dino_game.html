			This here is a variant of the Chrome Dinosaur game, which I tried to somewhat replicate. Sprites are courtesy of the internet and a
			little photo editing in GIMP. This game is not supported by Internet Explorer, or phones/tablets.Press the spacebar to jump over the Cacti.
			It takes "surviving" 4 cacti to go to the next level, with a cactus added onto this amount every 2 levels. The cacti will go by faster, so
			to make it slightly easier, expect a sharp increase in jump speed at levels 10 and 20. You will most likely lose, the question is how long
			you will last. <a target="_blank" href = "https://s4sikdar.github.io/">Here is the link back to website you most likely came from.</a> In the
			event that you press the spacebar and nothing happens, this means that not all images loaded. Refresh the page and try again. After a repeated
			number of attempts, the images will eventually all load. Enjoy!
