This is my replica of T-Rex Run. I created a colored variant of the original. The game can be found here: https://s4sikdar.github.io/chrome_dino_run/Dino_game.html. It was created 
with the canvas element, and coded manuually (i.e. without a game engine). This was due to the book I read on how to program in JavaScript (Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke).
In the book they coded a game from scratch as one of the projects, as an exercise in object oriented programming design. I attempted to do the same and "get my feet wet" with 
regrards to Object Oriented Programming - specifically prototypes in ES5. As a result, this program has over 1300 lines of JavaScript code. The game uses multiple layers of the 
canvas element, coding different levels of movement on each. The bright side of this is increase performance, the drawback being increased ram usage. As a result of this, the game 
does not support mobile phones or tablets. It also unfortunately does not support Internet Explorer, as the canvas element does not seem to work well on Internet Explorer - at least 
it didn't when I tried to create a canvas element. I have downloaded the Phaser game engine and will be working on an upgrade time willing. Thank you for your time.
