<p>
  This is my replica of T-Rex Run. I created a colored variant of the original. The game can be found <a href = "https://s4sikdar.github.io/chrome_dino_run/Dino_game.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. It was created with the canvas element, and coded manuually (i.e. without a game engine). 
  <ul>
    <li>Why was a game engine not used?</li>
    &ensp; 
    <p>
      I wanted to be comfortable with Vanilla JavaScript and ES6 before learning Front-End JavaScript frameworks, as learning JavaScript up till ES6 is required before being able
      to dive into REACTjs. Thus I wanted to create a project that was more code-heavy, which would give me more practice using features of ES6 such as higher order functions,
      Promises, Object Oriented Design in JavaScript (Prototypes and Classes), ES6 modules, and more. As a result, you will often see the JavaScript code making use of map
      functions in place of for loops at times. Also, the book I read on JavaScript (Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke) had created a computer game, but had used object 
      oriented design to create the game, as well as manually coded various functionality required for the game.

  </ul>

<p>The game uses multiple layers of the canvas element, coding different levels of movement on each. The bright side of this is increase performance, the drawback being increased ram usage. As a 
      result of this, the game does not support mobile phones or tablets. It also unfortunately does not support Internet Explorer, as the canvas element does not seem to work 
      well on Internet Explorer - at least it didn't when I tried to create a canvas element. I have downloaded the Phaser game engine and will be working on an upgrade time 
      willing. Thank you for your time.</p>
