            </h1>

				My name is Sailesh Sikdar. I'm in my 3B term at the University of Waterloo. I am in the Math/Business Administration program, open to working in front-end development,
        back-end development, or automation testing. The website was created by HTML and CSS, and the interactive buttons below were created in Javascript using the
				Document Object Model, as well as the jQuery library. I am also adept with Python, and created Tic Tac Toe using the minimax algorithm and OOP design.
				I have briefly dabbled in some Python libraries in the past (Openpyxl, Xlsxwriter, Pandas and Matplotlib). I have also taken a course in relational databases
        - search CS 338 UWaterloo - and used SQL/SQLite3. I am currently trying to learn Bootstrap and Material design, as well as REACT in the future.
				<span class = "Highlight">To show off some of my new skills in web development, here is highlighted text.</span>  Here is a link with the exact same style to represent
        copying stylesheets from one page to the next: <a href = "https://s4sikdar.github.io/Second_Page.html">The second page</a>. The menu above gives the same links.
        <a href = "https://github.com/s4sikdar" target = "_blank" class = "GitHub_Sentence"> Click this sentence for a link to my
				GitHub</a>, and <a href = "New Sailesh Sikdar Resume.pdf" target = "_blank" class = "GitHub_Sentence"> click here for a link to my resume.</a> Outside of Software Development,
        I am very interested in Investments and Finance, watching videos by Aswath Damodaran about corporate finance and valuation in my spare time on Youtube.
        I also like to read books on this subject, and am currently reading through the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.
        Some of my other hobbies are being an avid basketball fan, and losing money on Tesla puts thanks to r/wallstreetbets (lol just kidding).
