This repositiory has my portfolio website, which can be found here: https://s4sikdar.github.io/. It supports IE 11 and all other browsers, along with Phones and Tablets. The website was made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, the Intersection Observer API, the Mutation Observer API, and the Google Charts API. It also has one of my projects, a remake of the Chrome Dinosaur game, found here:
