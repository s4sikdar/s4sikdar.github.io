This repositiory has my portfolio website, which can be found here: https://s4sikdar.github.io/. It supports IE 11 and all other browsers, along with Phones and Tablets. The only caveat is that the graph does not change size when the window resizes. You have to refresh it and it will change size accordingly. It also has one of my projects, a remake of the Chrome Dinosaur game, found here:
